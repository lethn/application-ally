# Application Ally

This web application originated as a final project for our Web Programming class (CSCI 4300) at The University of Georgia. Following the project's completion, we implemented additional features to enhance its responsiveness and user experience. Our tech stack includes MongoDB as our database, Express for creating a RESTful API, React for the frontend, and Node.js as our backend. We also leveraged the popular frontend framework Next.js for its client-side rendering capabilities.
